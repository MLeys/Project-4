2. Assign individual subskills to user
3. See Codewars connection and rank per skill
4. Search and add resources to skills/ subskills
5. Search and add resorces from google
6. Store documents related to study, such as 'cheat sheets'
7. View and search youtube for content related to keywords/ skills/ subskills
